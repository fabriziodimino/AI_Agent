I was very enthusiastic to test these models because modern AI is no longer limited to learning from examples (ML); it now integrates a real reasoning component. DeepSeek R1 embodies this shift, delivering OpenAI-o1-level intelligence at up to 90% lower cost.

If the agent encounters challenges or makes errors, it can leverage its reasoning capabilities to self-correct.

- Exploration & Refinement: Learns more like a human, going beyond standard SFT.
- GRPO (Group Policy Optimization): Rewards both correct answers and clear, logical reasoning.
- Open Source & Local: Run them on your own PC—no proprietary libraries needed.

I integrated DeepSeek R1 into an AI agent leveraging RAG for a Wealth Manager application. Potential use cases include quickly retrieving a client’s conversation history, flagging urgent requests, and generating concise summaries.

1. Simulated Datasets: Generated via DeepSeek R1 (no real data required).
2. Function Calling: Handled by a SLM (e.g., Llama 3.2) to minimize latency.
3. Query Optimization: Performed by DeepSeek R1 to refine user inputs.
4. Final Response Generation: Again refined by DeepSeek R1 for clarity and logical coherence.

𝘗𝘳𝘰𝘴 & 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘴
- Ideal for tasks where in-depth logic and clarity are crucial.
- For simpler, faster operations (like function calls), SLMs (e.g., Llama 3.2) might be a better fit.
